# Fix Saved Foods Synchronization Issue

## Problem
After saving a food reel via POST /api/food/save, the changes don't reflect on the /saved page in grid form, even though it's saved to database.

## Root Cause
- No shared state management between Reels.jsx and Saved.jsx components
- Saved.jsx only fetches data on mount, no real-time updates
- Reels.jsx updates local state but doesn't communicate with Saved.jsx

## Solution Steps

### 1. Create SavedFoodsContext
- [ ] Create `frontend/src/contexts/SavedFoodsContext.jsx`
- [ ] Implement context with saved foods state and methods
- [ ] Add save/unsave functionality with API calls
- [ ] Add refresh functionality

### 2. Update App.jsx
- [ ] Import and wrap app with SavedFoodsContext provider
- [ ] Ensure context is available throughout the app

### 3. Update Reels.jsx
- [ ] Import and use SavedFoodsContext
- [ ] Replace local save state with context
- [ ] Update toggleSave function to use context methods
- [ ] Remove duplicate API calls

### 4. Update Saved.jsx
- [ ] Import and use SavedFoodsContext
- [ ] Replace local state with context state
- [ ] Remove manual fetchSavedFoods function
- [ ] Update handleUnsave to use context methods
- [ ] Add useEffect to refresh on component mount

### 5. Testing
- [ ] Test save functionality in Reels
- [ ] Test navigation to Saved page shows new items
- [ ] Test unsave functionality
- [ ] Verify real-time updates work correctly
