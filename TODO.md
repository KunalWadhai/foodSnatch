# Task: Fix Saved Page Issues

## Issues Fixed ✅

### 1. Video Autoplay Issue
- **Problem**: Videos on /save route were not autoplaying, showing as static images
- **Root Cause**: Video elements missing `autoPlay` attribute
- **Solution**: Added `autoPlay` attribute to video elements in Saved.jsx
- **Files Modified**: `frontend/src/pages/general/Saved.jsx`

### 2. handleUnsave Function Issue
- **Problem**: Users couldn't unsave selected food items on /save page
- **Root Cause**: Data structure mismatch - using `savedFood.food._id` instead of `savedFood.food.id`
- **Solution**: Corrected data structure access to match the frontend data mapping
- **Files Modified**: `frontend/src/pages/general/Saved.jsx`

## Changes Made

### frontend/src/pages/general/Saved.jsx
1. Added `autoPlay` attribute to video element:
   ```jsx
   <video
     src={savedFood.food.video}
     className="w-full h-48 object-cover"
     muted
     autoPlay  // ← Added this
     loop
     preload="metadata"
     // ...
   />
   ```

2. Fixed handleUnsave function data access:
   ```jsx
   onClick={() => handleUnsave(savedFood.food.id)}  // ← Changed from _id to id
   ```

## Backend Verification
- ✅ Backend `saveFoodReel` controller correctly handles both save/unsave operations
- ✅ Routes are properly configured for POST `/api/food/save`
- ✅ Data models are correctly structured

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test video autoplay functionality on saved page
2. Test unsave functionality by clicking bookmark button on saved items
3. Verify saved items are removed from the list after unsaving
4. Check that videos load and play automatically when page loads

## Status: ✅ COMPLETED
Both issues have been resolved and the fixes are ready for testing.
